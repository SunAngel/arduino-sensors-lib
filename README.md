# Sensors Library for Arduino

Here you can find some my files for Arduino IDE
(actually, they should work with any C compiler for AVR 
[and, mayby, not only avr], not only with Arduino IDE, 
but I didn't test them anywhere but Arduino IDE)

There are thei short description:
* [BH1750.h](/BH1750.h) - BH1750 I2C Light sensor 
* [BMP180.h](/BMP180.h) - BMP180 I2C Pressure sensor
* [DS18B20.h](/DS18B20.h) - DS18B20 1-Wire Temperature sensor
* [RTC.h](/RTC.h) - I2C Real Time Clock (Tested with DS3231)
* [voltageRead.h](/voltageRead.h) - Some functions for helping get voltage fro internal ADC.
